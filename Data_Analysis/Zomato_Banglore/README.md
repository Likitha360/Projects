- **Purpose**: To demonstrate data wrangling, visualization, and analysis skills using Python, applied to real-world restaurant data.
- **Tech Stack**: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Pandasql.
- **Dataset**: `zomato.csv` (sourced from Kaggle), with 51,717 entries and 17 features.
- **Status**: Complete as of March 2025, with results saved in a report and visualization.

## Features
