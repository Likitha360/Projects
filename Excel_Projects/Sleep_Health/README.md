# Sleep and Lifestyle Analysis

An Excel-based data analysis project exploring relationships between occupation, BMI, sleep quality, stress levels, and physical activity using a health dataset.

## Description
This project analyzes a health and lifestyle dataset in Microsoft Excel, focusing on metrics like sleep duration, quality of sleep, stress levels, physical activity, daily steps, BMI category, and occupation. Using Excelâ€™s pivot tables and data tools, it uncovers patterns such as how BMI and occupation influence sleep quality and stress, with breakdowns by gender and profession.
